## [Session 2: Cloud Platforms, APIs, and n8n Automation](https://github.com/K-upendra-7/abcd-agentic-training-vnr-upendra/tree/main/Session-02%2603)
* **ðŸ“… Date:** *10th September 2025*

### Topics Covered:
The session focused on the practical aspects of cloud platforms, API integrations, and workflow automation using n8n. The following key concepts were introduced:
* API Keys & OAuth
* Authentication vs. Authorization
* Cloud Platforms & Third-Party Integrations
* Docker for containerized workflows

### Practical Work:
* **Google Cloud Integration:** 
  * Successfully created a new project on Google Cloud.
  * Enabled the Email API.
  * Connected the Gmail API to an n8n workflow.

* **Telegram Bot Integration:** 
  * Created a new Telegram bot and generated the necessary API keys.
  * Integrated the Telegram APIs with an n8n workflow.

* **Troubleshooting & Testing:** 
  * Individually tested each node within the n8n workflows to ensure full functionality.
  * Collaboratively resolved Docker-related challenges and other integration issues that arose during setup.

### Practical Work:
The hands-on portion of the session involved building and deploying a real-time AI workflow.

  * An n8n workflow was created to integrate Gmail, the Gemini AI Chat Model, and Telegram.
  * Explored the essential components that AI agents rely on: input, chat models, memory, and tools.
  * Conducted node-by-node testing to validate the functionality of the entire workflow.
  * The workflow was deployed live and tested in real-time scenarios.
