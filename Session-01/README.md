## Session 1: GitHub Integration, ML, and Full Stack
* **ðŸ“… Date:** 30th August 2025

### ðŸ“šTopics Covered:
* **Part 1: GitHub & Version Control** 
  * **Core Concepts:** A deep dive into essential Git commands and GitHub features including:
    * `push`, `pull`, and `pull request`
    * `branches` (local & remote)
    * Resolving `merge conflicts`
    * Managing `issues` for tracking tasks
  * **Practical Labs:** We completed three hands-on labs to solidify these concepts.
    * [Lab 1: Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
    * [Lab 2: Reviewing Pull Requests](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests)
    * [Lab 3: Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts)
  * **Collaboration:** Discussed strategies for effective teamwork on a shared codebase using GitHub.

* **Part 2: Machine Learning & API Integration** 
  * **ML Fundamentals:** An overview of the machine learning lifecycle was provided.
    * Topics included data segregation (training/testing), prediction, algorithms, model creation, and model tuning.
    * A brief introduction to neural networks was also covered.
  * **Model Deployment:** Learned about storing trained ML models as `.pkl` files and using them in full-stack applications.
  * **APIs in Action:** A live demonstration using Chrome DevTools showed how to inspect API requests and responses, including methods, headers, and payloads.
