# Agentic AI Training – Learning Journal

This repository is my personal record of learning from the **Agentic AI Training Program**.  
The purpose of this repo is to track my journey, capture key concepts, and document practical experiments that I work on during and after each session.  

By maintaining this log, I can reflect on my progress, revise concepts whenever needed, and build a solid foundation in **LLMs, GenAI, and Agentic AI**.

## Prerequisites & Prep Checklist

This section will help me stay prepared before each session.  
(Items will be updated as more details are shared during the program.)

- [ ] Install **Python 3.10+**  
- [ ] Set up a **virtual environment** (e.g., `venv` or `conda`)  
- [ ] Install **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**  
- [ ] Install **PyTorch / TensorFlow** (depending on training needs)  
- [ ] Create a **GitHub account & repo** (this repository)  
- [ ] Familiarize with **Git basics** (clone, commit, push)  
- [ ] Review **fundamentals of AI/ML** (ML models, transformers, embeddings)  
- [ ] Install any **libraries listed in the training materials**  
- [ ] Optional: Explore basic **LLM APIs** (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)  

*(This checklist will be refined as new requirements are shared.)*

## Learning Journal

This section contains notes and reflections from each training session.  
Every session entry will include the **date, topics covered, learnings, and my hands-on practice notes**.  

## Session 1: GitHub Integration, ML, and Full Stack
* **Date:** 30th August 2025
### Topics Covered
#### **Part 1: GitHub & Version Control**
* **Core Concepts:** A deep dive into essential Git commands and GitHub features including:
    * `push`, `pull`, and `pull request`
    * [cite_start]`branches` (local & remote) 
    * [cite_start]Resolving `merge conflicts` 
    * [cite_start]Managing `issues` for tracking tasks 
* [cite_start]**Practical Labs:** We completed three hands-on labs to solidify these concepts.
    * [Lab 1: Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
    * [Lab 2: Reviewing Pull Requests](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests)
    * [Lab 3: Resolving Merge Conflicts](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts)
* **Collaboration:** Discussed strategies for effective teamwork on a shared codebase using GitHub.

#### **Part 2: Machine Learning & API Integration**
* **ML Fundamentals:** An overview of the machine learning lifecycle was provided.
    * Topics included data segregation (training/testing), prediction, algorithms, model creation, and model tuning.
    * A brief introduction to neural networks was also covered.
* **Model Deployment:** Learned about storing trained ML models as `.pkl` files and using them in full-stack applications.
* **APIs in Action:** A live demonstration using Chrome DevTools showed how to inspect API requests and responses, including methods, headers, and payloads.
