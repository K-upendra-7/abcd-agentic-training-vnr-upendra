# Agentic AI Training – Learning Journal

This repository is my personal record of learning from the **Agentic AI Training Program**.  
The purpose of this repo is to track my journey, capture key concepts, and document practical experiments that I work on during and after each session.  

By maintaining this log, I can reflect on my progress, revise concepts whenever needed, and build a solid foundation in **LLMs, GenAI, and Agentic AI**.
