# Agentic AI Training ‚Äì Learning Journal

This repository is my personal record of learning from the **Agentic AI Training Program**.
The purpose of this repo is to track my journey, capture key concepts, and document practical experiments that I work on during and after each session.

By maintaining this log, I can reflect on my progress, revise concepts whenever needed, and build a solid foundation in **LLMs, GenAI, and Agentic AI**. üí°

    * Topics included data segregation (training/testing), prediction, algorithms, model creation, and model tuning.
    * A brief introduction to neural networks was also covered.
  * **Model Deployment:** Learned about storing trained ML models as `.pkl` files and using them in full-stack applications.
  * **APIs in Action:** A live demonstration using Chrome DevTools showed how to inspect API requests and responses, including methods, headers, and payloads.

## [Session 2: Cloud Platforms, APIs, and n8n Automation]()
* **üìÖ Date:** *10th September 2025*

### Topics Covered:
The session focused on the practical aspects of cloud platforms, API integrations, and workflow automation using n8n. The following key concepts were introduced:
* API Keys & OAuth
* Authentication vs. Authorization
* Cloud Platforms & Third-Party Integrations
* Docker for containerized workflows

### Practical Work:

  * Successfully created a new project on Google Cloud.
  * Enabled the Email API.
  * Connected the Gmail API to an n8n workflow.

* **Telegram Bot Integration:** 
  * Created a new Telegram bot and generated the necessary API keys.
  * Integrated the Telegram APIs with an n8n workflow.

* **Troubleshooting & Testing:** 
  * Individually tested each node within the n8n workflows to ensure full functionality.
  * Collaboratively resolved Docker-related challenges and other integration issues that arose during setup.

## [Session 3: Agentic AI, Transformers, and Advanced n8n Workflows]()
* **üìÖ Date:** *10th September 2025*
 
### üìö Topics Covered:
This session advanced both practical integration skills and the theoretical understanding of AI concepts.

* **T-Shaped Developer & Agentic AI:** 
  * Introduced the T-shaped developer model, which encourages broad general knowledge with a deep specialization in Agentic AI.
  * Studied core Agentic AI concepts including frameworks, hallucination management, and vectorization.
  * Mapped student skills against the growth path toward becoming an Agentic AI developer.

* **Transformer Architecture Concepts:**
