## Session 6 & 7 â€“ Agentic Frameworks, LangChain, and OpenAI Agents
**ðŸ“… Date:** *18th October 2025* (Online Session)

### ðŸ“šTopics Covered:
* Recap: Using OpenAI SDK core (without framework).
* **Morning Session:**
  * Implemented Agentic workflows using **OpenAI Agents SDK**.
  * Learned **asyncio** operations and tracing in OpenAI.
  * Practical work on **Agents, Handoffs, and Guardrails**.
  * Tools used: SendGrid (Email), Google WebSearchTool.
  * Built a Sales Manager setup with handoffs.

* **Afternoon Session:**
  * Used **LangChain** and **LangGraph** to implement agentic workflows.
  * Learned concepts of nodes, edges, state, reducers, and immutability.
  * Integrated with **LangSmith**, **Serper.dev**, **SendGrid**, and **Pushover**.
  * Implemented persistent and in-memory storage using SQLite.
  * Used decorators: `@function_tool`, `@input_guardrails`, etc.

### My Learnings: 
  * Implemented memory and tracing mechanisms in agentic systems.
  * Gained hands-on experience with OpenAI Agents SDK and LangChain ecosystem.
  * Built a complete, traceable agentic workflow with notifications and handoffs.
  * Understood when and why to use different frameworks (SDK, LangChain, LangGraph).

### Practice Work: 
  * Completed lab exercises.
  * Uploaded documentation, flow diagrams, and code to GitHub.
  * Demonstrate a real-world implementation using the personalized model.
  * Improve  personalized LLM use case with one tool and one resource from last session with all new concepts.
